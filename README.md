### Option 1 - New York Times

Use the New York Times API to create a website of your choice. Suggestions include creating a movie review site or a most popular article chart.

Your site must be interactive, try adding a search bar or a filter.

The implementation of what you do with the API is completely up to you.

You will have to **require an API key**. This is sent relatively quickly.
